Custom GPG pinentry program for macOS that allows using Touch ID for fetching the password from the
macOS keychain.

> Macbook Pro devices without Touch ID are currently not supported. These devices > lack a Touch ID
> sensor and while the alternative offered by Apple is to use (if available) an Apple Watch, this
> feature it is not yet implemented.

## How does it work

This program interacts with the `gpg-agent` for providing a password, using the following rules:

- If the password entry for the given key cannot be found in the Keychain we fallback to the
  `pinentry-mac` program to get the password. We recommend preventing `pinentry-mac` from storing the
  password: uncheck the <kbd>Save in keychain</kbd> checkbox in the dialog.

- If a password entry is found the user will be shown the Touch ID dialog and upon successful
  authentication the password stored from the keychain will be returned to the gpg-agent.

- If a password entry is found but is not "owned" by the `pinentry-touchid` program after the
  successful authentication with Touch ID, a normal password will be shown. This is an extra step
  enforced by the macOS keychain. In this dialog click <kbd>Always allow</kbd> after entering the
  password. This will allow `pinentry-touchid` to access the password entry without the need to type
  the additional password, but still, the access to the password will be guarded by Touch ID.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

* [gnupg](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/gnupg)
* [pinentry-mac](https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry-mac)


If you have already installed GPG, make sure that executing `pinentry` shows a GUI prompt by running
the following command:

```sh
$ echo GETPIN | pinentry
```

You should get the dialog from [pinentry-mac](https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry-mac). If that is not the case you can install it though Homebrew:

```sh
$ brew install pinentry-mac
```

You can overwrite the `pinentry` alias to point to `pinentry-mac`:

```sh
$ alias pinentry='pinentry-mac'
```

_Then try again whether you see a GUI prompt._

In some cases aliasing `pinentry` to `pinentry-mac` is not enough because `gpgconf` returns the
absolute path that points to the `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt` path. In that case you can execute the
following command to automatically fix the symlink.

```sh
$ pinentry-touchid -fix
```

### Homebrew


As part of our release process we keep an updated Homebrew Formula. To install `pinentry-touchid` using
Homebrew execute the following commands:

```sh
$ brew tap jorgelbg/tap
$ brew install pinentry-touchid
```

Homebrew will print the next steps, which will look similar to:

```
==> Caveats
‚û°Ô∏è  Ensure that pinentry-mac is the default pinentry program:
      /usr/local/bin/pinentry-touchid -fix

‚úÖ Add the following line to your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf file:
      pinentry-program /usr/local/opt/pinentry-touchid/bin/pinentry-touchid

üîÑ  Then reload your gpg-agent:
      gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye

üîë  Run the following command to disable "Save in Keychain" in pinentry-mac:
    defaults write org.gpgtools.common DisableKeychain -bool yes

‚õîÔ∏è  If you are upgrading from a previous version, you will be asked to give
    access again to the keychain entry. Click "Always Allow" after the
    Touch ID verification to prevent this dialog from showing.

```

### Manual installation

- Download the `pinentry-touchid` binary from our Releases page

- Configure the `gpg-agent` to use `pinentry-touchid` as its pinentry program. Add or replace the
  following line to your gpg agent configuration in: `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`:

```sh
$ pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-touchid
```

You can replace `/usr/local/bin/pinentry-touchid` with the path where the binary was stored.

Make sure that the `pinentry-mac` is configured to be the default `pinentry` program (will be used
as fallback). You can check which PIN program will be used by default by executing:

```sh
$ pinentry-touchid -check
```

If any error is reported `pinentry-touchid` can automatically fix the symlink for you:
```sh
$ pinentry-touchid -fix
```

## Configuration

We recommend disabling the option to store the password in the macOS Keychain for the default
pinentry-mac program with the following option:

```sh
$ defaults write org.gpgtools.common DisableKeychain -bool yes
```

This will allow `pinentry-touchid` to create and automatically take ownership of the entry in the
Keychain. If an entry already exists in the Keychain you need to always allow `pinentry-touchid` to
access the existing entry.

## Disclaimer

This project does not store the password/pin in the [Secure
Enclave](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/security/sec59b0b31ff/web) of your device, instead
uses the normal Keychain entry from
[pinentry-mac](https://github.com/GPGTools/pinentry/tree/master/macosx) if available, or creates a
new one.

* MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018), macOS Catalina - 10.15.7
* MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2018), macOS Big Sur - 11.4, 11.5.0, 11.5.1
* MacBook Pro (16-inch, Late 2019), macOS Big Sur - 11.4, 11.5.1
